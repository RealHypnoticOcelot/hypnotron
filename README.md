# Hypnotron
###### Multipurpose Discord Bot



## How to use:
Install the requirements using the following command:

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you add a token, run the bot, invite the bot to your server, the setup is all done! Currently, there are no configurable commands at this time or ways to disable commands, but I plan to continue work on this bot!

After you get a token from https://discord.com/developers/applications, run:
```python
python3 bot.py
```
